      <string name="atbirth_wte">
     • Almost immediately after birth, your baby is in a unique alert stage and may 
    latch on for the first time seeming like a pro \n
 • Allow the baby to stay with you skin-to-skin while the baby seeks 
out the breast and nipple 
 • While some babies may latch on at this time, many will simply 
“explore” by licking, bobbing their head, and possibly taking a few small sucks \n
 • Remember, all of this is normal and the most important thing at this 
time is to be skin-to-skin with your baby and allow the baby access to your 
breast for a feeding attempt if the baby seems interested   \n
      </string>
      
      <string name="twentyfourhours_wte">
     • This is a learning time for you and your baby \n
 • Make sure to spend lots of time together skin-to-skin \n 
 • Many babies will seem very sleepy during this first 
24 hours and you may need to wake your baby for feeds \n
 • If your baby is uninterested in the breast during this time, 
try hand-expressing your colostrum directly into your baby’s mouth \n
      </string>
      
       <string name="twodays_wte">
     • Your baby will be waking up more by this time. It may seem like all your baby wants to do is nurse.
     This is normal! \n
 • Your colostrum fills the baby’s tiny belly and is easily digested, 
therefore making the baby ready for more in a short amount of time \n
 • Keep up with the frequent feeds and skin-to-skin, because at this 
point your milk may be beginning to transition into your mature milk and 
frequent nipple stimulation will help this to occur \n

      </string>
      <string name="threedays_wte">
           • Many women describe day three as one of the most difficult of all,
           so great job making it here and keep up the good work \n
 • At this point, you can expect your baby’s latch to be improving and you
 are both getting the hang of it \n
 • Your baby’s appetite may seem insatiable and it seems 
like you’re feeding constantly. Again, this is normal and your 
baby is just helping to bring your milk supply in \n
          
      </string>
      
      <string name="fourdays_wte">
         • Many women will experience their milk “coming in” at this time
          and you may wake up with your breasts feeling very full and firm \n
• It is critical at this time that you feed your baby
 frequently and on cue so that the baby can regulate your milk supply to fit his or her needs \n
• Your milk may be changing in color at this point from yellowish to white 
• Your baby may choose to take each breast during one feeding, or he or 
she may choose to nurse on one side only and then begin with the other 
side at the next feeding—either way is normal \n 
          
      </string>
      
       <string name="oneweek_wte">
       • By now your mature milk should definitely have come in, if breastfeeding is going well \n
• Your baby should now be gaining weight, 
rather than losing it because they are able to take in a greater volume of your milk with each feed \n
• Your baby should still be feeding frequently and on demand \n
• Fussiness is common at this time and should not be confused for 
hunger or the baby “not getting enough” \n
-if you are concerned your baby is not getting enough milk you should call your pediatrician \n
